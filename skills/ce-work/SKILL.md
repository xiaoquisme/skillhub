# Work Execution Command

## Setup

Run this once at the start of this invocation, before any subagent dispatch, and follow the directives it prints — except where one conflicts with this skill's own rules on asking the user questions, whether those rules are scoped to a non-interactive mode or apply in every mode, in which case this skill's rules win and no blocking question is asked. Run the fence exactly as written, as its own command: do not pipe or filter it (no `head`, `tail`, or `grep`), do not truncate its output, and do not bundle it into a batch with other commands. Its output opens with a `=== skill context` header and ends with `CE_CONTEXT_END`; if you received one of those lines without the other, the output was truncated — rerun the fence verbatim once. That recovery is the only rerun: otherwise do not rerun it within the same invocation; a later invocation of this or any other skill runs its own. If no Node runtime is available the skill proceeds unchanged.

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the SKILL.md you just read>";
NODE="$(for c in node nodejs; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -e '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)";
if [ -n "$NODE" ]; then
"$NODE" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/context.mjs" || echo "context script failed; continue with the skill's normal behavior";
else
echo "no Node runtime; continue with the skill's normal behavior";
fi
```

## Outcome

- **Result:** A fully implemented, locally verified change set from a plan, specification, or concrete work prompt.
- **Next consumer:** In standalone use, the shipping workflow takes the verified change through review and delivery. In Return-to-Caller Mode, the invoking workflow receives the structured implementation and verification envelope and owns its remaining gates.
- **Done:** Every in-scope task is complete, required verification evidence is recorded, relevant checks pass, and the run reaches either its owned shipping handoff, a complete return envelope, or an explicit blocker.
- **Intent:** Finish the requested feature without renegotiating the plan or transferring canonical integration authority. Workers receive bounded units; the host orchestrator inspects actual changes and owns authoritative verification and canonical commits.

## Input Document

The **input document** for this run is the input this skill was invoked with — present in the current prompt or conversation, whether the user provided it directly or a calling skill passed it (e.g. `lfg` in `mode:pipeline`, which passes a plan path). It may be a plan or spec path, a `mode:` token followed by a path, or a bare work prompt. The rest of this skill refers to it as `<input_document>`; if nothing was provided, treat `<input_document>` as blank.

Invocation origin is not observable or relevant: apply the same source-resolution rules whether the user invoked `ce-work` explicitly or the host selected it automatically.

## Artifact Root

This skill discovers plans under `<root>/plans/` and may write review residuals under `<root>/residual-review-findings/`. Resolve `<root>` when you first compose a `<root>/` path (per the block below), never before you need it. A write to `<root>/...` and a read of `<root>/solutions/` both count as composing a `<root>/` path, so either one triggers resolution; only a run that touches no `<root>/` path at all -- a scratch-only or no-repo flow -- skips it; pass the resolved path to any subagent, not the config.

<!-- ce-docs-root:start -->
**Resolve the CE artifact root `<root>` before composing any artifact path.**

- **Read** `docs_root` from `<repo-root>/.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml`, then `config.yaml`; first non-empty value wins (`<repo-root>` = `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). Unset -> `<root>` is `docs`, exactly as before.
- **Validate** a set value: a repo-relative directory whose real, symlink-resolved path stays inside the repo and is neither the repo root nor under `.git/`. Otherwise stop with an error naming `docs_root` and the value -- never fall back to `docs`.
- **Use** `<root>` as the sole artifact location: create it if absent, compose each path as `<root>/<subdir>` with this skill's own subdirectory, and never also read `docs`.
<!-- ce-docs-root:end -->

## Execution Workflow

**Bundled reference loading is fail-closed.** Resolve every bundled reference or script path named below from this skill's loaded `SKILL.md` directory, using the skill full path supplied by the harness; never glob the target repository to find a bundled file. If the harness does not expose that directory or a required file cannot be read, stop before the action governed by it and report the missing reference instead of approximating the protocol or continuing natively.

### Phase 0: Input Triage

**Recovery activation comes first.** Before normal plan, path, blank-input, or bare-prompt classification, interpret whether the user is semantically asking to resume, inspect status, reap, or clean up an existing external implementation run and has supplied its run id. This is intent recognition, not verb-only matching. Validate the id with the controller's safe-id contract: `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}$` and at least one non-period character. When this direct recovery intent is present, read `references/cross-model-execution.md`, use that run id as authoritative for the requested controller operation, and return the observed state or blocker. Recovery must not dispatch a new worker, select a new route, fall through to latest-plan discovery, or run either shipping tail. When every unit is already cleaned, **completed recovery is read-only reconciliation**: Do not rerun test, build, format, install, generation, or `verify-run`; report the stored unit and plan-wide verification receipts. If recovery intent is clear but the run id is missing, request the id instead of guessing or classifying the text as new work.

**Otherwise, parse a leading mode token.** If `<input_document>` begins with `mode:return-to-caller` (or the legacy aliases `mode:caller-owned-tail` / `caller:lfg`), strip that token before anything else and enter **Return-to-Caller Mode** (see § Return-to-Caller Mode) — implement and locally verify only, then return the structured envelope instead of running the standalone shipping tail. Before the plan path, accept up to two optional carriers in this fixed order: first one compact JSON object prefixed exactly `implementation_engine:`, then one run id prefixed exactly `implementation_run:`. The engine object remains the typed caller binding and must contain exactly `mode`, `target`, `model`, and `source` with the types and values defined in `references/execution-engines.md`; the run carrier is accepted only for return-to-caller recovery and must satisfy the safe-id contract above. Reject malformed JSON, missing/extra fields, an unsafe run id, or a duplicate carrier. The entire remaining string is the plan path. A mode token or carrier with no following path is an error; report it instead of treating control data as a bare prompt. Without either optional carrier, the original `mode:return-to-caller <plan-path>` form is unchanged and standing configuration remains eligible.

When `implementation_run:<safe-id>` is present, recovery wins over ordinary input classification: read `references/cross-model-execution.md`, use `resume --run-id <safe-id>` as the authoritative entrypoint, and return the normal Return-to-Caller envelope after reconciliation. Preserve the supplied `implementation_engine` binding when present. Do not resolve a different route, redispatch, reimplement, rerun completed verification, or start another caller tail.

When a valid `implementation_engine:` binding is present without recovery, **pre-controller discovery is read-only**. Do not run baseline, test, build, format, install, or generation commands in the canonical checkout before resolving the binding and initializing the external controller: those commands can create ignored or untracked artifacts before the controller records its clean starting point. Limit triage to reads such as metadata, source, configuration, branch, status, and command-availability probes. If a non-read probe is genuinely required to decide whether the route can start, run it only with artifact suppression and prove the canonical Git snapshot is byte-for-byte unchanged before continuing; otherwise stop with a route blocker.

**Resolve a session-carried plan before blank or bare-prompt classification.** When the current request is continuation language such as "proceed" and the conversation identifies exactly one current plan/spec path that was authored, selected, or accepted for this work, treat that path as `<input_document>`. If multiple session plans are plausible, ask which one; do not choose by recency. Do not replace a concrete new work request with an unrelated earlier plan. This rule depends only on visible conversation state, never on whether invocation was explicit or automatic.

**Every non-recovery code path must resolve its implementation engine before execution.** Once metadata or prompt triage identifies code work, but before reading active implementation units, creating tasks, writing files, or committing, read `references/execution-engines.md` and perform its route-resolution gate. This applies with or without an `implementation_engine:` carrier: inspect `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` when it exists, because standing configuration remains eligible in both standalone and carrierless Return-to-Caller Mode. Do not choose inline/native execution until that gate has ruled out or validly exhausted the applicable higher-authority routes.

Determine how to proceed based on what was provided in `<input_document>` (after any mode token is stripped).

**Plan document** (input is a file path to an existing plan or specification): read the plan's metadata first — YAML frontmatter for a markdown plan, or the visible header text for an HTML plan (both formats carry the same fields).

- If it carries `artifact_contract: ce-unified-plan/v1`, classify `artifact_readiness` before reading the body.
  - `artifact_readiness: requirements-only` -> stop and tell the user this Product Contract needs `ce-plan` enrichment before implementation. Offer the exact `ce-plan <plan-path>` handoff.
  - `artifact_readiness: implementation-ready` plus `execution: code` -> continue to Phase 1 using the unified-plan reader strategy below.
  - Any other readiness value or any non-code/unclassified execution mode -> do not auto-execute as code. Route `execution: knowledge-work` to the non-code carve-out; otherwise ask the user to return to `ce-plan` to produce an implementation-ready code plan.
  - Progress-like values (`active`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `done`) are invalid readiness values. Stop and ask for plan repair rather than guessing.
- If it carries `execution: knowledge-work`, this is a **non-code plan** — read `references/non-code-execution.md` and follow that carve-out instead of the rest of this workflow.
- Otherwise (legacy plan, field absent, or `execution: code`) -> continue to Phase 1 and run the normal code lifecycle.

**Blank invocation latest-plan discovery:** when `<input_document>` is blank, glob `<root>/plans/*.md` and `<root>/plans/*.html`, inspect metadata for the newest candidates, and only auto-select a plan that is `artifact_readiness: implementation-ready` plus `execution: code` or a legacy code plan. Stop instead of silently executing when the newest matching artifact is requirements-only, `execution: knowledge-work`, an approach-plan, or an unclassified universal/answer-seeking output. Ask for an explicit path or a `ce-plan` enrichment step. **Superseded sibling:** if a requirements-only candidate has a same-basename file in the other format (`<basename>.md` / `<basename>.html`) that is `implementation-ready`, a format conversion left the requirements-only copy stale — select the implementation-ready sibling and execute it rather than stopping.

**Bare prompt** (input is a description of work, not a file path):

1. **Scan the work area**

   - Identify files likely to change based on the prompt
   - Find existing test files for those areas (search for test/spec files that import, reference, or share names with the implementation files)
   - Note local patterns and conventions in the affected areas

2. **Assess complexity and route**

   | Complexity | Signals | Action |
   |-----------|---------|--------|
   | **Trivial** | 1-2 files, no behavioral change (typo, config, rename) | Proceed to Phase 1 step 2 (environment setup), skip only the task list, then run step 4's mandatory engine-resolution gate before implementing directly — no unit execution loop. Apply Test Discovery if the change touches behavior-bearing code |
   | **Small / Medium** | Clear scope, under ~10 files | Build a task list from discovery. Proceed to Phase 1 step 2 |
   | **Large** | Cross-cutting, architectural decisions, 10+ files, touches auth/payments/migrations | Inform the user this would benefit from `ce-brainstorm` or `ce-plan` to surface edge cases and scope boundaries. Honor their choice. If proceeding, build a task list and continue to Phase 1 step 2 |

   Do not treat an unclear prompt as external-worker authority. If discovery cannot state a concrete goal, bounded scope, and authoritative verification, clarify or route to `ce-plan` before any cross-model egress.

---

### Phase 1: Quick Start

1. **Read Plan and Clarify** _(skip if arriving from Phase 0 with a bare prompt)_

   - For unified plans, size your read. A short plan (lightweight or requirements-only, a screen or two) can be read in full. For a long implementation-ready plan, do **not** read the whole document first — it is expensive and unnecessary. Build a section map, then read only what the active unit needs: metadata, then `Goal Capsule`, `Verification Contract`, `Definition of Done`, the `Implementation Units` heading list, and only the active U-ID section plus referenced R/F/AE/KTD excerpts and any Product Contract Key Decision whose `Governs R…` links name those Rs (that reverse link is how a product decision's `session-settled:` label reaches you). Read appendices or unrelated U-IDs only when the active unit cites them. To build the map: in **markdown** scan headings (`rg -n '^#{1,3} ' <plan>` — top-level sections plus `### U<N>.` units); in **HTML** scan the `<h1>`–`<h3>` heading elements and their anchor ids. Match on the stable section names / unit IDs (`Goal Capsule`, `Verification Contract`, `### U<N>.`, …), ignoring HTML wrapper tags — not on a format-specific pattern.
   - For legacy plans, read the work document completely. Both formats (`.md`, `.html`) carry the same section names and IDs; HTML just wraps them in semantic elements (`<section>`, `<article>`, etc.).
   - Treat the plan as a decision artifact, not an execution script
   - If the plan includes sections such as `Implementation Units`, `Work Breakdown`, `Requirements` (or legacy `Requirements Trace`), `Files`, `Test Scenarios`, or `Verification`, use those as the primary source material for execution
   - Check for `Execution note` on each implementation unit — these carry the plan's natural-language execution direction for that unit (for example, start from failing proof, characterize legacy behavior, or prefer smoke/runtime verification). Note them when creating tasks, but do not reduce them to keyword matching.
   - Check for a `Deferred to Implementation` or `Implementation-Time Unknowns` section — these are questions the planner intentionally left for you to resolve during execution. Note them before starting so they inform your approach rather than surprising you mid-task
   - Check for a `Scope Boundaries` section — these are explicit non-goals. Refer back to them if implementation starts pulling you toward adjacent work
   - Review any references or links provided in the plan
   - If the user explicitly asks for TDD, test-first, characterization-first execution, or a specific verification style in this session, honor that direction even if the plan has no `Execution note`
   - If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions now
   - If clarifying questions were needed above, get user approval on the resolved answers. If no clarifications were needed, proceed without a separate approval step — plan scope is the plan's authority, not something to renegotiate
   - **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing
   - **Do not edit the plan body during execution.** The plan is a decision artifact; progress lives in git commits and the task tracker, not the plan. `ce-work` does not mutate the plan — whether it shipped is derived from git, not recorded in the doc. Legacy plans may contain `- [ ]` / `- [x]` marks on unit headings or a `status:` field — ignore them as state; per-unit completion is determined during execution by reading the current file state.

2. **Setup Environment**

   First, check the current branch:

   ```bash
   current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
   default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')

   # Fallback if remote HEAD isn't set
   if [ -z "$default_branch" ]; then
     default_branch=$(git rev-parse --verify origin/main >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "main" || echo "master")
   fi
   ```

   **If already on a feature branch** (not the default branch):

   First, check whether the branch name is **meaningful** — a name like `feat/crowd-sniff` or `fix/email-validation` tells future readers what the work is about. Auto-generated worktree names (e.g., `worktree-jolly-beaming-raven`) or other opaque names do not.

   If the branch name is meaningless or auto-generated, suggest renaming it before continuing:
   ```bash
   git branch -m <meaningful-name>
   ```
   Derive the new name from the plan title or work description (e.g., `feat/crowd-sniff`). Present the rename as a recommended option alongside continuing as-is.

   Then ask: "Continue working on `[current_branch]`, or create a new branch?"
   - If continuing (with or without rename), proceed to step 3
   - If creating new, follow Option A or B below

   **If on the default branch**, choose how to proceed:

   **Option A: Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git pull origin [default_branch]
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
   Use a meaningful name based on the work (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`, `fix/email-validation`).

   **Option B: Use a worktree (recommended for parallel development)**
   ```bash
   skill: ce-worktree
   # Ensures isolation: detects an existing worktree, prefers the harness's
   # native worktree tool, else creates one from the default branch
   ```

   **Option C: Continue on the default branch**
   - Requires explicit user confirmation
   - Only proceed after user explicitly says "yes, commit to [default_branch]"
   - Never commit directly to the default branch without explicit permission

   **Recommendation**: Use worktree if:
   - You want to work on multiple features simultaneously
   - You want to keep the default branch clean while experimenting
   - You plan to switch between branches frequently

3. **Create Task List** _(skip if Phase 0 already built one, or if Phase 0 routed as Trivial)_
   - Use the platform's task-tracking capability when available (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` in Claude Code, `update_plan` in Codex, or the equivalent on other harnesses) to break the plan into actionable tasks. If none is available, continue normally without simulating a task list in chat
   - Derive tasks from the plan's implementation units, dependencies, files, test targets, and verification criteria
   - When the plan defines U-IDs for Implementation Units, name each task from a brief, outcome-led form of the unit's Goal and append the stable U-ID (e.g., "Add parser coverage (U3)"). Never use a bare U-ID or lead with the identifier; the user should understand the work before the traceability label. Aim for five words or fewer before the ID
   - When the full unit list is visible, do not repeat ordinal counts such as "unit 1 of 5" in every task. Add an ordinal only when the harness exposes the current task without the surrounding list and the count materially improves orientation
   - Carry each unit's `Execution note` into the task when present
   - For each unit, read the `Patterns to follow` field before implementing — these point to specific files or conventions to mirror
   - Use each unit's `Verification` field as the primary "done" signal for that task
   - Do not expect the plan to contain implementation code, micro-step TDD instructions, or exact shell commands
   - Include dependencies between tasks
   - Prioritize based on what needs to be done first
   - Include testing and quality check tasks
   - Keep tasks specific and completable

4. **Choose Execution Engine, then Strategy**

   **Route resolution is a mandatory pre-write gate.** Before any implementation write, native worker dispatch, or implementation commit, read `references/execution-engines.md`; inspect applicable live/session/project intent, any typed caller binding, and `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` when it exists; then resolve and record the engine. Do not infer native execution merely because no typed carrier was supplied. Native is eligible only after this gate finds no higher-authority cross-model selection or exhausts a `prefer` route under the reference's fallback contract.

   First pick the **engine** that runs implementation: inline/subagent, goal-mode, dynamic-workflow, or cross-model execution. When no applicable live intent, typed caller binding, or enabled standing configuration selects cross-model execution, native execution remains the default inline/subagent path. Goal-mode and dynamic-workflow remain limited to implementation-ready unified code plans and are usable only when the host exposes a callable primitive for them — Codex exposes `create_goal` (a skill can start a goal directly), while Claude Code exposes no goal tools, so on Claude Code they are prompt-emission only (never invoked from inside this skill). Prefer dynamic-workflow over goal-mode for large fan-out plans (many independent U-IDs, codebase-wide sweeps, migrations, adversarial cross-checking). The loaded reference defines authority-and-scope route resolution, the ordered standing preference contract, host-capability probe, plan-shape selection table, copyable goal-mode/`ultracode:` prompts, and resume-tail rules. An engine choice never changes tail ownership — after implementation, resume standalone quality gates in normal use, or return the return-to-caller envelope when invoked by `lfg`. Legacy and bare-prompt code work otherwise use the inline/subagent engine directly.

   If and only if cross-model execution is selected, you must read `references/cross-model-execution.md` before any repository content, bounded mutation authority, or other material crosses the fixed route. That reference defines the fixed-route transaction, controller commands, failure stops, and receipts. Do not approximate it with an ordinary subagent dispatch.

   **A successful controller `init` locks that unit to the selected cross-model engine.** From that point, advance it through the controller protocol or return blocked with its recovery path. Never reclassify it as trivial, abandon it for speed, or implement it natively unless the protocol later returns an explicit fallback authorization.

   For a bare prompt with no resolved plan, the loaded reference requires a private **bounded implementation brief** before controller initialization: synthesize only the concrete request, discovered scope, acceptance/verification, inherited constraints, exclusions, and conservative unit breakdown. Do not send raw conversation history. If those fields cannot be populated without guessing, do not egress; return to Phase 0 clarification or planning. This bridge is identical for explicit and automatically selected invocations.

   For the inline/subagent engine, **prefer subagents for any structured multi-unit plan** — each worker gets a fresh context window for one unit. **Parallelize independent units whenever it is safe**; fall back to serial only when parallel isn't safe or the harness can't isolate concurrent writes. Let the plan's `Dependencies` and `Files` drive batching: run an independent dependency layer together, then the next.

   | Strategy | When to use |
   |----------|-------------|
   | **Inline** | Trivial work (1-2 files, no real decomposition), work needing user interaction mid-flight, or bare prompts that lack structured units |
   | **Serial subagents** | The default for structured multi-unit plans whose units are dependent, few, or whose parallel-safety is uncertain. Fresh context per unit, executed in dependency order |
   | **Parallel subagents** | Independent units (per the Parallel Safety Check) when you want the speed and the harness can isolate concurrent work. Run a dependency layer at once, then the next |

   **Parallel Safety Check** — scheduling is separate from engine and workspace selection. Apply this gate to native and cross-model candidates before dispatching a wave:

   1. Start only with units whose dependencies are already committed and whose peers in the same readiness layer do not depend on one another.
   2. Map declared files to units from each candidate's `Files:` section, then reason beyond those declarations. File overlap is necessary but not sufficient: shared types/APIs/interfaces, migrations, lockfiles, generated artifacts/clients, registry or config/schema surfaces, and an environment singleton (one dev server/port, shared database, browser session, package install, or rate limit) all create contention.
   3. Estimate expected merge and verification cost. Even isolated workers serialize when they share a contract or when reconciling their likely outputs is not obviously smaller and safer than serial authoring.
   4. Dispatch together only when dependencies, declared files, semantic surfaces, runtime resources, and expected merge cost all support independence; **decline parallelism on uncertainty**. Speed is optional.
   5. Require an isolated workspace for every concurrent worker. A synchronous native unit stays in the active checkout, but a shared-workspace worker runs serially regardless of declared file disjointness.
   6. Cap concurrency at a bounded batch (~3-5 workers), even when more units appear independent.
   7. Abort criteria: broad unplanned edits, semantic overlap, out-of-scope failures, or repeated collision disables further waves; preserve or finish affected work serially.

   **For ordinary native workers, isolation is the harness's job, never ce-work's** — never run `git worktree add` yourself for inline/subagent, goal-mode, or dynamic-workflow execution. The only exception is the external cross-model controller, which owns its detached sibling worktrees outside the repository under the separate cross-model protocol. Probe what your native subagent mechanism provides and pick the parallel path:
   - **Harness-native isolated workers** — each worker edits an isolated workspace the harness manages: for example, Claude Code `Agent` with worktree isolation or a harness worker capability whose receipt confirms an isolated workspace. This works even when you are already inside a worktree because the harness-managed worktrees are peers, not nested. Parallelize only units that pass the Safety Check; isolation makes recovery possible, not overlap safe.
   - **Shared workspace only** — subagents edit your working directory. Run them serially. Do not infer isolation from the presence of a subagent API; use only a capability the active harness actually exposes.
   - **No subagent mechanism:** run inline.

   **Native dispatch (inline/subagent engines only)** uses your harness's subagent/worker mechanism. Once a unit is selected for cross-model execution, use the loaded controller protocol for that unit; it must not re-enter this ordinary subagent dispatch.

   **Fresh worker invariant (native subagent dispatch only):** When dispatching an implementation unit to a native subagent worker, create a new worker context with no prior implementation-unit transcript. Bind the worker handle to exactly that unit: it may continue or recover the same unit, but never receive a different unit. Retire each handle after its unit is integrated; never retask it or retain idle implementation workers for reuse. Invoke an explicit close/release operation only when the active harness exposes one and assigns that lifecycle action to the caller. Inline execution creates no worker context or handle, so it has nothing to retire.

   Give each native worker:
   - The plan path plus a **bounded unit packet** and inherited authority — Goal Capsule, Definition of Done, the unit's section, the Verification Contract entries relevant to it, any referenced R/F/AE/KTD excerpts, **plus any Product Contract Key Decision whose `Governs R…` links name the unit's cited R-IDs** (its `session-settled:` annotation reaches the worker only through this reverse link — cited KTDs alone carry only planning-decision labels). A downstream worker may narrow that unit and authority, never broaden either. Do not send "read the whole plan" as the worker prompt. (For a legacy non-unified plan, the plan path for reference is acceptable.)
   - The unit's Goal, Files, Approach, Execution note, Patterns, Test scenarios, Verification, and any resolved deferred questions for it.
   - Instruction to check whether the unit's test scenarios cover all applicable categories (happy paths, edge cases, error paths, integration) and supplement gaps before writing tests.
   - **Instruction to choose the unit's evidence strategy and gather the evidence** (see Evidence Strategy in Phase 2) — for behavior-bearing changes, honor the Execution note and default to proof-first or characterization-first: create/update/strengthen the test and observe the red failure or characterization baseline **before** changing production code. The worker is the only party that witnesses this, so it must capture it as it goes.
   - **Instruction to report, in its final message, both (a) the file paths it changed and (b) the unit's verification evidence** — `behavior_changed`, existing tests inspected, tests added/changed or used unchanged, the red failure or characterization observed (when applicable), the verification run and result, and any deliberate no-test exception with its reason. The handoff is a text summary on most harnesses with no guaranteed diff, so reported paths are the orchestrator's starting hint (it still verifies the actual tree); the evidence fields are **not** reconstructable from the tree afterward, so a worker that omits them forces the orchestrator to re-derive or leave `verification_evidence` incomplete.
   - **Do not commit.** Ordinary native workers implement and may run their *own unit's* focused tests in isolation as a self-check, but the **orchestrator owns staging, committing, and the authoritative test runs**. An external cross-model worker may create isolated transport commits only under its conditional protocol; those are change transport, never canonical commits. (Capability note: a harness that *reaps* the isolated workspace on worker completion — none of our current targets do — would instead require the worker to commit to its branch; confirm before assuming it.)

   **Shared-workspace constraints** — when subagents share your working directory (no isolation): they must not `git add`, commit, or run the full test suite concurrently (index corruption + test interference); the orchestrator does all of that after the batch. A worker may run a single focused unit test only if it touches no shared state.

   **Permission mode:** Omit the `mode` parameter when dispatching subagents so the user's configured permission settings apply. Do not pass `mode: "auto"` — it overrides user-level settings like `bypassPermissions`.

   **After each serial inline/subagent unit:** review the diff against the unit's scope and `Files:`, run the relevant tests, fix before starting the next (never on a broken tree), record the unit's verification evidence (from the worker's return when a worker ran), update the task list (never edit the plan body — progress lives in commits), and commit. If the unit used a native subagent worker, retire its handle (closing/releasing it only when the harness exposes that operation and assigns that lifecycle action to the caller), then dispatch the next subagent unit in a new worker context. An inline unit has no worker handle to retire; start the next unit directly.

   **After a parallel inline/subagent batch — the orchestrator integrates; never trust the handoff summary alone:**
   1. Wait for every worker in the batch to finish.
   2. **Inspect the actual tree, not reported paths.** Determine what each worker really changed (`git status`/diff in its workspace or the shared dir). Reported paths are a hint; declared `Files:` are often incomplete — workers create/modify files the plan didn't anticipate.
   3. **Detect real collisions and semantic contention** — compare actual paths plus shared contracts, generated/config surfaces, and verification effects. A clean merge is not proof of compatibility. Preserve or re-run colliding units on the advancing canonical base; never blind-merge them.
   4. **Review, test, commit, and retire each unit in dependency order — the orchestrator owns commits.** Integrate one result, inspect actual scope, run authoritative verification, create its canonical commit, then immediately retire that unit's worker before considering the next. Never send the retired handle another implementation unit or keep it in an orchestrator-managed idle pool. Invoke an explicit close/release operation only when the harness exposes it and assigns that lifecycle action to the caller; otherwise completion is the worker's release boundary. Clean up an isolated workspace only when the harness assigns that cleanup to the caller and only after proving the unit's work was integrated — never infer manual cleanup commands from the provider name. Revalidate every remaining result against the advancing canonical tree. Capture each worker's returned verification evidence into the run's `verification_evidence` roll-up — if a worker omitted it, re-derive what the tree allows and mark the rest as unverified rather than fabricating a red-before-implementation observation the worker never reported.
   5. Update the task list (progress lives in the commits).
   6. Dispatch the next dependency layer only after every unit in the batch has been integrated and its worker retired. Any remaining isolated-workspace cleanup follows the active harness's ownership and lifecycle contract.

   **Per-harness integration (examples — the universal flow above is the contract):**
   - **Harness-owned worktree/branch:** integrate one branch in dependency order, verify, and commit before the next; on conflict abort and re-run or explicitly resolve that unit against the advanced tree.
   - **Harness-owned uploaded change set:** accept one isolated result, inspect and verify it, commit it canonically, then release the worker before the next result.
   - **Shared workspace:** no parallel batch is permitted; use the serial path.
   - **External cross-model workspace:** follow the conditionally loaded cross-model parallel-wave protocol and controller receipts; ordinary branch-merge shortcuts do not apply.

### Phase 2: Execute

Before implementing the first task, you must read `references/implementation-loop.md`. Follow that reference for every task's evidence choice, implementation, verification, and completion stops before moving to incremental commits.

2. **Incremental Commits**

   After completing each task, evaluate whether to create an incremental commit:

   | Commit when... | Don't commit when... |
   |----------------|---------------------|
   | Logical unit complete (model, service, component) | Small part of a larger unit |
   | Tests pass + meaningful progress | Tests failing |
   | About to switch contexts (backend → frontend) | Purely scaffolding with no behavior |
   | About to attempt risky/uncertain changes | Would need a "WIP" commit message |

   **Heuristic:** "Can I write a commit message that describes a complete, valuable change? If yes, commit. If the message would be 'WIP' or 'partial X', wait."

   If the plan has Implementation Units, use them as a starting guide for commit boundaries — but adapt based on what you find during implementation. A unit might need multiple commits if it's larger than expected, or small related units might land together. Use each unit's Goal to inform the commit message.

   **Commit workflow:**
   ```bash
   # 1. Verify tests pass (use project's test command)
   # Examples: bin/rails test, npm test, pytest, go test, etc.

   # 2. Stage only files related to this logical unit (not `git add .`)
   git add <files related to this logical unit>

   # 3. Commit with conventional message
   git commit -m "feat(scope): description of this unit"
   ```

   **Handling merge conflicts:** If conflicts arise during rebasing or merging, resolve them immediately. Incremental commits make conflict resolution easier since each commit is small and focused.

   **Note:** Incremental commits use clean conventional messages without attribution footers. The final Phase 4 handoff passes `branding:on` so `ce-commit-push-pr` can add generic Compound Engineering branding to the PR.

   **Parallel subagent mode:** Commit ownership is split by isolation mode (see Phase 1 Step 4):
   - **Worktree-isolated:** subagents may stage and commit inside their own worktree branch; the orchestrator merges those branches in dependency order after the batch.
   - **Shared-directory fallback:** subagents do not commit; the orchestrator stages and commits each unit after the entire parallel batch completes.

3. **Follow Existing Patterns**

   - The plan should reference similar code - read those files first
   - Match naming conventions exactly
   - Reuse existing components where possible
   - Follow the project's coding standards already in your context
   - When in doubt, grep for similar implementations

4. **Test Continuously**

   - Run relevant tests after each significant change
   - Don't wait until the end to test
   - Fix failures immediately
   - Add new tests for new behavior, update tests for changed behavior, remove tests for deleted behavior
   - **Unit tests with mocks prove logic in isolation. Integration tests with real objects prove the layers work together.** If your change touches callbacks, middleware, or error handling — you need both.

5. **Simplify as You Go**

   After completing a cluster of related implementation units (or every 2-3 units), review recently changed files for simplification opportunities — consolidate duplicated patterns, extract shared helpers, and improve code reuse and efficiency. This is especially valuable when using subagents, since each agent works with isolated context and can't see patterns emerging across units.

   Don't simplify after every single unit — early patterns may look duplicated but diverge intentionally in later units. Wait for a natural phase boundary or when you notice accumulated complexity.

   If **`ce-simplify-code`** is available, invoke it at phase boundaries (especially before Phase 3 when the accumulated cluster has >=30 substantive changed code lines — count human-authored code, not total diff lines, so a mostly test-fixture/config/generated/mechanical cluster does not trip the gate). Otherwise, review the changed files yourself for reuse and consolidation opportunities.

   When the plan carries `session-settled:`-labeled KTDs or Key Decisions, pass the plan path as structure-pin context, not as the simplification scope, with the one-line constraint that labeled entries are structure pins the simplification must preserve (e.g., deliberate duplication stays duplicated).

6. **Figma Design Sync** (if applicable)

   For UI work with Figma designs:

   - Implement components following design specs
   - Read `references/agents/figma-design-sync.md` and dispatch a generic subagent seeded with that local prompt to compare implementation against the Figma design. Do not dispatch a standalone agent by type/name.
   - Fix visual differences identified
   - Repeat until implementation matches design

7. **Frontend Design Guidance** (if applicable)

   For UI tasks without a Figma design -- where the implementation touches view, template, component, layout, or page files, creates user-visible routes, or the plan contains explicit UI/frontend/design language:

   - Apply the frontend guidance embedded in this skill and the active repo instructions: preserve existing design-system conventions, use real UI controls and states, keep layouts responsive, and verify text does not overflow or overlap.
   - When browser tooling is available, inspect the changed UI at desktop and mobile widths before final validation. If no browser access is available, do a code-level responsive/layout review and record that browser verification was unavailable.
   - Phase 4's screenshot capture still applies when the change is user-visible.

8. **Track Progress**
   - Keep the task list updated as you complete tasks
   - Note any blockers or unexpected discoveries
   - Create new tasks if scope expands
   - Keep user informed of major milestones
   - When the plan defines U-IDs for Implementation Units, or the plan or origin document carries stable R-IDs (and optionally A/F/AE IDs), reference them in blockers, deferred-work notes, task summaries, and final verification — not routine status updates. U-IDs anchor units across plan edits; R/A/F/AE anchor product intent across the brainstorm-plan handoff. Use the IDs the plan supplies and do not invent ones it does not. This preserves traceability without burying signal under noise.

### Phase 3-4: Quality Check and Finishing Work

When all Phase 2 tasks are complete and execution transitions to quality check, you must read `references/shipping-workflow.md` for the full shipping workflow. Do not skip this.

**Code review: one portable path.** Review with `ce-code-review`, which self-sizes (lite roster for small low-risk code-only diffs, full roster otherwise). No harness-native review detection and no escalation tiers — the size/sensitive-surface judgment lives inside `ce-code-review`. Skip dedicated review only for a purely mechanical diff (formatting, dep-bumps, lint-only, generated). Full rules (autonomous Residual Gate, infra fallback) in `shipping-workflow.md`.

**Review is two steps — review, then fix.** `ce-code-review` is review-only. It returns findings (markdown or `mode:agent` JSON); it never edits the checkout, commits, or applies fixes.

1. **Review** — Invoke the `ce-code-review` skill (invocation command in `references/review-findings-followup.md` § Fallback). Use `mode:agent` in orchestrated workflows; pass `plan:<path>` when you have a plan, `base:<ref>` when the merge base is known, and `depth:full` when a deep/thorough review was explicitly requested.
2. **Apply fixes** — Load `references/review-findings-followup.md`. Filter eligibility on JSON only, **batch applicable findings by file**, dispatch fix subagents (parallel when file sets are disjoint). The orchestrator merges diffs, runs tests, and commits — it does not pre-investigate findings.
3. **Residual Work Gate** — Only after followup; unresolved actionable findings go through the gate in `shipping-workflow.md` (autonomous sessions auto-accept + record residuals; interactive sessions ask).

## Return-to-Caller Mode

`mode:return-to-caller [implementation_engine:<compact-json>] [implementation_run:<safe-id>] <plan-path>` (legacy alias: `mode:caller-owned-tail`) is
reserved for orchestrators such as `lfg` that own the post-implementation
shipping gates (final simplify, code review, PR creation, and CI watching).
In this mode `ce-work` performs implementation and local verification only —
including mid-implementation Phase 2 "Simplify as You Go" — then returns a
structured summary instead of running the standalone shipping tail.

Return:

- `status`: `complete`, `blocked`, or `failed`
- `plan_path`
- `changed_files`
- `u_ids_attempted`
- `u_ids_completed`
- `verification_results`
- `verification_evidence`: one entry per attempted behavior-bearing unit, plus any non-behavioral unit where tests were intentionally skipped. Each entry states the unit/task, `behavior_changed`, `existing_tests_inspected`, `tests_added_or_changed`, tests used unchanged, red failure or characterization observed when applicable, verification commands/results, and any exception reason. For units executed by subagents, this entry is assembled from each worker's returned evidence (Phase 1 Step 4), not reconstructed from the diff — the red-before-implementation observation exists only in the worker's report.
- `implementation_engine_binding`: the resolved one-run `mode`, `target`, `model`, and `source`, or `null` when native execution was selected without a binding
- `requested_route` and `actual_route`: target plus harness/intermediary identity, kept separate when fallback or same-family substitution occurred
- `requested_model` and `actual_model`: the request and receipt-attributed served identity (`unverified` when the route supplies no trustworthy receipt)
- `fallback_reason`: `null` when none, otherwise the observed route-unavailable or substitution reason
- `run_id`: durable external run identifier, or `null` for native execution
- `source_kind` and `source_digest`: controller-recorded implementation authority (`plan` plus its digest in Return-to-Caller Mode; standalone bare-prompt runs use `prompt`)
- `unit_receipts`: route, model, detached-process, integration, verification, canonical-commit, and cleanup state for each attempted unit
- `plan_checkpoint`: the disclosed checkpoint commit when the selected plan was the only canonical dirt, otherwise `null`
- `blockers`
- `recovery_path`: preserved owner-checked run/workspace location when recovery remains, otherwise `null`
- `settled_decision_conflicts`: conflicts with `session-settled:`-labeled KTDs or Key Decisions encountered during implementation — each entry names the labeled entry, the evidence, and how it was routed (proceeded-and-flagged vs blocker); empty when none
- `behavior_change`: whether behavior-bearing code changed
- `standalone_shipping_skipped: true`

Return `status: complete` only when behavior-bearing work has verification evidence or a deliberate exception. If a previous return-to-caller run implemented code but omitted evidence, a later same-plan return-to-caller run should use the idempotency check to inspect the existing work, complete the evidence, and return without reimplementing.

Engine selection (`references/execution-engines.md`) still applies in this mode,
but only for implementation. In return-to-caller mode do not emit a copyable
goal/workflow prompt — a manual paste step strands the caller; run
inline/subagents or return a blocker instead. Any goal/workflow engine used here
must not open a PR, run the owner workflow tail, or bypass the caller-owned
gates.

## Key Principles

### Start Fast, Execute Faster

- Get clarification once at the start, then execute
- Don't wait for perfect understanding - ask questions and move
- The goal is to **finish the feature**, not create perfect process

### The Plan is Your Guide

- Work documents should reference similar code and patterns
- Load those references and follow them
- Don't reinvent - match what exists
- A KTD or Product Contract Key Decision carrying a `session-settled:` annotation (classes `user-directed` / `user-approved`) records a decision the user already made — it is not yours to improve. A product decision's label arrives through the Key Decision whose `Governs R…` links name your unit's Rs, not through a KTD. This scopes to labeled entries only: details the plan leaves open remain your judgment, and a real defect discovered inside a settled approach is still surfaced at full strength — the label never suppresses defect evidence. If implementation reveals a labeled decision is invalidating-grade unworkable (infeasible, wrong-thing, destructive), that is a genuine blocker: surface it rather than silently working around or "fixing" the decision

### Test As You Go

- Run tests after each change, not at the end
- Fix failures immediately
- Continuous testing prevents big surprises

### Quality is Built In

- Review every non-mechanical diff with `ce-code-review` (it self-sizes; see `shipping-workflow.md`)

### Ship Complete Features

- Mark all tasks completed before moving on
- Don't leave features 80% done
- A finished feature that ships beats a perfect feature that doesn't

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Analysis paralysis** - Don't overthink, read the plan and execute
- **Skipping clarifying questions** - Ask now, not after building wrong thing
- **Ignoring plan references** - The plan has links for a reason
- **Testing at the end** - Test continuously or suffer later
- **Forgetting to track progress** - Update task status as you go or lose track of what's done
- **80% done syndrome** - Finish the feature, don't move on early
- **Skipping review without reason** — review every non-mechanical diff with `ce-code-review`; skip only for a purely mechanical diff or when it is genuinely unavailable, and document the skip reason
- **Re-scoping the plan into human-time phases** - The plan's Implementation Units define the scope of execution. Do not estimate human-hours per unit, propose multi-day breakdowns, or ask the user to pick a subset of units for "this session". Agents execute at agent speed, and context-window pressure is addressed by subagent dispatch (Phase 1 Step 4), not by phased sessions. If a plan-file input is genuinely too large for a single execution, say so plainly and suggest the user return to `ce-plan` to reduce scope — don't invent session phases as a workaround. For bare-prompt input, Phase 0's Large routing already handles oversized work
