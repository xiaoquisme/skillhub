# Phase 3: Adversarial Corpus Audit

Produces one finding set per corpus unit, each finding carrying a defender ruling. That ruling set is the input to Phase 4's passes — nothing here edits a file.

The audit is not evidence. It ranks candidates; only the harness says whether a cut helped. Do not let a large finding count imply a large effect — a corpus's run-to-run spread on fixed inputs (`references/noise-floor.md`) is the same whether the audit found 6 findings or 600.

## Dispatch shape

**The two waves must run as separate dispatched agents.** A defender's ruling is only worth recording when it can genuinely disagree with the proposal that reached it, which one context holding both roles cannot do. If the host exposes no way to run them as independent agents, report that as a blocker and stop the audit — do not run the waves inline and hand the result to Phase 4. The same context arguing both sides still emits confident `cut` rulings, and Phase 4 deletes on them: that is the demolition this reference warns about below, arriving through the dispatch layer instead of a weak model tier.

Two waves, one agent per unit each way.

**Wave 1 — proposers.** One agent per corpus unit. Give it the unit's **full directory**, not just its entry file: conditionally-loaded reference files are usually the bulk of a unit and the entry file alone hides them. Instruct it to return the finding schema below and nothing else — no summary prose, no recommendations about other units.

**Wave 2 — defenders.** One agent per unit, given that unit's directory *and* its proposal set, with the opposite job: find a reason each targeted line exists. A defender must search three sources, and must say which it searched:

1. The project's own documented learnings and solution docs.
2. The test suite — grep a distinctive substring of the target text.
3. Version history — `git log -S '<substring>'` for the commit that introduced the line, then read that commit message and the PR it belongs to.

Source 3 is unavailable in a corpus checkout with no history, which is the normal shape of an installed or vendored copy. A defender working without history must say so in `sources_searched` and cannot return `cut` on the strength of the other two alone — that combination is "no provenance found in two of three sources", which is a verification task, not a cut. Point defenders at a checkout that has history, or record the whole audit's provenance basis as partial.

**Pipeline the waves.** Start a unit's defense as soon as its proposal set returns; do not wait for wave 1 to finish — the two waves share no state across units. It is 2N dispatches on N units, so plan the wave count against the host's concurrency cap (`references/workflow-shapes.md`).

Keep defenders on a capable model tier. A defender that cannot read a test suite and reconstruct intent from a commit message returns "no provenance found" for everything, which silently converts the audit into a demolition.

## Finding schema

Per finding:

| Field | Shape |
|---|---|
| `id` | stable, `<unit>-<nnn>`; defenses and later passes reference findings by id |
| `target` | `path/to/file.md:line` or a line range |
| `class` | exactly one value from the closed enum below |
| `size` | estimated words removed |
| `text` | the offending text verbatim, long enough to relocate after other edits land |
| `why_unneeded` | what a capable model does here without being told |
| `replacement` | the thinner line, or empty for pure deletion |
| `risk` | low / medium / high; high means it touches a contract, a guard, or a string a test may pin |

Per unit, in addition to the findings:

- `must_survive` — every line that must not be cut, each with its reason. See "Protocol regardless of model tier" below for what belongs here.
- `halt_sites` — every place where prose could make an orchestrating model end its turn while naming work it did not do. Quote each verbatim. This list is the highest-value output of the whole phase; a unit that reports zero halt sites has almost certainly not looked at its phase boundaries. `references/halt-taxonomy.md` carries the classes.

## Classes worth hunting

Ordered by expected behavior change per finding, not by word count. The last entry yields the most words and the least behavior.

| Class | Diagnostic question |
|---|---|
| `phantom-handoff` | Does the party this sentence hands off to — a reviewer, a caller, a next agent, a consumer of the artifact — exist in this run? |
| `step-machinery` | Would a different order, or skipping the ceremony, produce a different artifact? |
| `capability-restatement` | Would the model do this if the line were deleted? |
| `filler-rationale` | Does the rule survive intact if the sentence after it is removed? |
| `vestigial-mode` | Grep the corpus for a caller that sets this mode, flag, or branch. Is there one? |
| `mandatory-fanout` | Is this helper dispatch or self-verification pass conditional on anything, or does it fire every run regardless of need? |
| `cross-unit-duplication` | Is this block near-identical elsewhere, and is factoring it out actually permitted? |
| `oversized-reference` | Could this file's entire content be five lines? |

Two notes that change how the results read:

- **`phantom-handoff` is the class that causes halts.** Prose written as if a second party were waiting teaches the model to stop and wait. Hunt it at phase boundaries first.
- **Separate always-loaded prose from conditionally-loaded references when you tally `size`.** They cost differently: always-loaded prose is context cost on every run, a conditionally-loaded file is runtime cost only when loaded. A corpus can be mostly conditional, which makes raw word count overstate context cost and understate runtime cost. Report the split.

## Defender rulings

Exactly three, one per finding:

- **`cut`** — a real search over all three sources found no provenance. The proposal stands.
- **`reduce`** — the constraint is real and the prose states it at several times the length needed. The defender returns the minimal form that preserves the constraint.
- **`keep`** — concrete citable provenance a capable model could not infer: a test asserting it, a documented learning, or a commit that added it to fix a named bug. The ruling must carry the citation — path, test name, or sha.

A defender returns one row per finding, in these fields, and nothing else:

| Field | Shape |
|---|---|
| `id` | the proposer's finding id, unchanged; a ruling that cannot be joined back is discarded |
| `ruling` | `cut` / `reduce` / `keep` |
| `sources_searched` | which of the three, named; plus the query used, so an empty search is visible |
| `citation` | required on `keep`: path, test name, or sha. Empty is not a `keep` |
| `minimal_form` | required on `reduce`: the shortest text preserving the constraint |
| `pinning_test` | test path and assertion if a grep of the target text hits the suite, else empty |

**"A weaker model might need it" is not grounds for `keep`. Only citable provenance is.** Without that rule every line survives, because a defender asked to defend can always imagine a reader who needed the line. Where the unmeasured weaker tier is a genuine concern, the ruling is still `cut` or `reduce`, and the tier becomes a logged verification task in the Phase 5 limits report — not a keep.

Symmetrically: a defender who returns `cut` without naming which sources it searched has not searched. Send it back once; treat a second empty search as an unaudited unit and say so.

## Protocol regardless of model tier

For three categories the default inverts: **absence of provenance is not grounds to cut.** A capable model cannot re-derive them, so keep them even when no citation turns up. This is the one unrecoverable mistake in the phase — everything else a later pass can put back after a failed run, and these fail silently.

1. **Machine-readable strings other units parse** — field names, enum values, output paths, greppable markers, sentinel lines. These are arbitrary shared conventions; nothing makes them true except agreement, so no amount of model capability recovers a changed one.
2. **Security guards.**
3. **Platform gotchas where the wrong behavior looks like success.** Their unifying property: *the model cannot discover them by trying*, because trying returns something that looks fine. A flag that returns empty instead of erroring, so a run reports zero findings and calls itself clean. A config key whose commented-out example matched a naive substring check and silently forced every user into the wrong mode.

What *is* cuttable around all three is the justification clause — the sentence explaining that a separate consumer is waiting on the string. Keep the data, cut the story about who wants it. That is usually a `reduce`, and it is frequently also a `phantom-handoff`.

`cross-unit-duplication` collides with this category more than any other class. Before proposing a factor-out, check whether the duplication is mandated: a documented decision, or a test that forbids sharing the block. The most-duplicated block in a corpus is often the one thing that must stay duplicated — in the engagement it was a security guard whose duplication a test explicitly required, and the largest duplication mandate was itself the documented fix for a bug that had regressed twice.

## Synthesis: rank contradiction above confirmation

The synthesis leads with what contradicts the premise the audit started from, before any cut list. Answer three questions explicitly:

- **Which proposals did defenders save, with citations?** Report the count and the strongest saves. A defense rate near zero means the defenders did not search, not that the corpus is pure junk.
- **Which unit was leaner than its word count implied?** Use the always-loaded / conditionally-loaded split. The largest unit by words is often not the largest by context cost.
- **Where does the corpus already contain a documented argument against its own ceremony that nobody had grepped for?** Corpora that document their own decisions accumulate these. A duplication mandate that is itself the recorded fix for a bug that regressed twice is the shape to look for — the ceremony you were about to cut may be a scar.

A synthesis that only confirms the premise is a finding about the audit, not about the corpus. Say so rather than shipping it.

**The per-unit partition does not carry forward.** Findings arrive grouped by unit because that is how they were gathered; Phase 4 groups them by problem, and one problem's findings cross many units (`references/cut-passes.md`). Emit the ruled findings as a flat, id-addressable set with `class` and `target` intact so a pass can select across units. Handing Phase 4 a per-unit bundle produces one agent per unit editing one problem each — the collision shape Phase 4 exists to avoid.

## Test pinning is the rate limiter

Expect roughly half of `reduce` items to be pinned by a test asserting exact strings. That, not authoring effort, sets how many items a pass can carry.

- Grep each `reduce` target's distinctive substring against the test suite **during the audit** and record the pinning test in the finding. Discovering the pin during Phase 4 costs a whole pass.
- Budget the assertion retarget as part of the item, not as follow-up. Moving an assertion from a wording to the invariant it was protecting is often larger than the prose edit.
- **A half-applied structural fix is worse than either endpoint.** If a pass cannot land both the prose change and the retarget, leave the item unstarted. A corpus half-migrated between two shapes has the ceremony of both and the guarantees of neither, and the harness cannot attribute a resulting failure to either shape.
- If the invariant a pinned string was protecting cannot be named, that is a finding to report, not a license to loosen the assertion.
