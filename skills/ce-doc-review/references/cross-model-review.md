# Cross-Model Judgment Pass

Runs ce-doc-review's **conditional judgment lenses** through one separately routed model target in read-only, least-privilege processes. Each peer gets the **same** persona brief the in-process reviewer uses, returns the same `findings-schema.json` shape, and folds into synthesis as reviewer `<reviewer-name>-<provider>`. It counts as independent corroboration and can promote agreement only when its receipt records `independence_verified: true`; otherwise it remains attributed review evidence without a promotion bonus.

The trio is the three **conditional** judgment lenses whose output diverges most across model families: `adversarial-document-reviewer`, `product-lens-reviewer`, `security-lens-reviewer`. The convergent lenses (`coherence`, `scope-guardian`) and the always-on `feasibility` lens do **not** run cross-model — feasibility is excluded specifically so the pass stays conditional and does not spawn on every review.

The host resolves and sanctions one concrete route before egress; the bundled **`scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh`** enforces that fixed route, composes the prompt, applies least privilege, captures schema-shaped JSON, and normalizes identity receipts. The pass is non-blocking: a failed route writes no fold-in artifact and never switches recipients internally.

## Gate — run only when this holds

Run the cross-model pass for a given trio lens **only when that lens was activated** for this document by the normal Phase 1 persona-selection logic. No new activation triggers are introduced: a routine plan with validated upstream provenance and no high-stakes domain activates none of the trio, so it gets no cross-model pass. The document is already guaranteed readable on disk by Phase 1's missing-document gate — there is no diff and no remote-scope concern, so no additional scope gate is needed.

## Step 1 — Attest host identity, then sanction one fixed route

Keep four identities separate: requested **target**, CLI **harness/intermediary**, serving **family/provider**, and served model. `cursor` means `cursor-agent` with its configured default/Auto model and therefore has no `--model` flag. `composer` means an explicit Composer-family model through `cursor-agent`. `grok` prefers the native Grok CLI; Grok through Cursor is a different route and recipient even though the requested target remains Grok.

Attest both the host harness and its serving family:

```bash
if [ "${CLAUDECODE:-}" = "1" ]; then XHOST_HARNESS=claude; XHOST_FAMILY=claude;
elif [ -n "${CODEX_SANDBOX:-}${CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED:-}${CODEX_SESSION_ID:-}${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}${CODEX_CI:-}" ]; then XHOST_HARNESS=codex; XHOST_FAMILY=codex;
elif [ -n "${CURSOR_AGENT:-}${CURSOR_CONVERSATION_ID:-}" ]; then XHOST_HARNESS=cursor; XHOST_FAMILY=unknown;
else XHOST_HARNESS=unknown; XHOST_FAMILY=unknown; fi
```

Pass `XHOST_HARNESS` as `CROSS_MODEL_HOST_HARNESS`; pass `XHOST_FAMILY` as the first worker argument. Claude Code maps to harness/family `claude`; Codex maps to `codex`. Cursor maps to harness `cursor` and family `unknown` unless an observable serving-family attestation lets you set `XHOST_FAMILY` to `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, or `composer`. An unknown host family cannot satisfy automatic same-family exclusion, so skip the automatic cross-model pass. Never infer serving family from the Cursor brand.

Resolve the preference in this order:

1. A preference the user **states in conversation** (e.g. "use grok for the cross-model pass").
2. `cross_model_peer:` in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` (the only file the script/skill reads for this).
3. A preference already in your **project instructions** (the active instructions in your context) — consumed from context, **never** read from a named file.
4. **Default:** first available attested-different target in `codex → claude → grok → composer`; Cursor-default participates only when explicitly preferred.

Before content egresses, resolve each selected target to one concrete installed route, verify every recipient against `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS`, announce it, and pass it as `CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE`. `CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE` accepts exactly these tokens — the worker fail-closes on anything else (including route-shaped guesses like `codex-cli`):

| Target | Route token(s) |
|--------|----------------|
| `codex` | `codex` |
| `claude` | `claude` |
| `grok` | `grok-cli` (native CLI) or `grok-cursor` (via Cursor intermediary) |
| `cursor` | `cursor` |
| `composer` | `composer` |

A failed dispatched route returns no artifact; it never changes provider or intermediary internally. A retry is a new host decision and requires disclosure/sanction before dispatch. For backward compatibility, either `cursor` or `composer` in `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` sanctions Cursor as an intermediary, but selecting a Cursor-default voice itself requires target `cursor`; `grok` alone never sanctions Grok-via-Cursor.

Preferred model mappings run first. Only after the preferred ID is observed unavailable, obsolete, or incompatible may the host inspect current CLI capabilities and choose the closest compatible **same-target/same-family** replacement. Bind it with both `CROSS_MODEL_MODEL_OVERRIDE_TARGET=<target>` and `CROSS_MODEL_MODEL_OVERRIDE=<model-id>`. Never substitute across families, apply one target's override to another route, silently change an explicit model, or add a recipient.

## Step 2 — Provider model + reasoning tier (owned by the script)

All activated lenses run on **one model per provider at high reasoning, except Codex on extra-high** (composer's `-fast` tier is its ceiling — accepted exceptions). The concrete model IDs and per-route reasoning flags live in a **single mapping in the script** (`scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh`, the `M_CODEX`/`M_CLAUDE`/`M_GROK`/`M_GROK_CURSOR`/`M_COMPOSER` constants and the `adapter_argv` builder). This reference deliberately does **not** restate the IDs — one source of truth prevents the reference and script from drifting. The IDs are the current instance of the tier principle (a single maintenance point), not the contract.

The **persona file** basename and the **reviewer name** are distinct: the script reads the brief from `references/personas/<persona-file>.md` but forces the fold-in `reviewer` field to `<reviewer-name>-<provider>` so agreement matches the in-process persona's short name. The script derives the persona-file from the allowlisted reviewer-name — it is **not** a caller argument, so no caller value reaches the brief-read path.

## Step 3 — Announce

- **Interactive host, default interactive mode:** surface a **prominent standalone line** that frames it as an **independent cross-model review** of the judgment lenses (say "cross-model" / "independent model" — not the internal "peer" jargon), names the concrete **model and reasoning level** from the in-script mapping (e.g. GPT-5.6-luna at extra-high reasoning, Opus at high, Grok 4.5 at high, Composer 2.5-fast), and — because two different models can arrive over the *same* `cursor-agent` CLI — names **the route as well as the model** for cursor-agent routes so Grok-4.5-via-cursor-agent, Composer-via-cursor-agent, and Grok-4.5-via-the-grok-CLI are unambiguous, **and states that full document content is sent to that provider** (third-party egress; for cursor-agent routes the egress is to Cursor *plus* the serving provider). **Announce wording follows the receipt:** name a model as serving only where the route carries a served-model receipt; on receipt-less routes say "requested <model>; serving model unverified on this route" instead of asserting the concrete model. Placed with the Phase 2 team announce, not buried after it. Wording is yours; the falsifiable requirements: prominent, reads as a **cross-model reviewer** (not a generic persona), names the requested model (with the unverified marker on receipt-less routes), names the route when it is cursor-agent, names the egress. Example: `🔀 Cross-model pass — the judgment lenses are also being reviewed by an independent model: requested **Grok 4.5 (high reasoning), via cursor-agent** (serving model unverified on this route). Full document content is sent to xAI/Cursor.`
  - Call the pass **independent** only when host and target serving families are attestably different. For Cursor default/Auto or an unknown host family, call it a cross-harness review and state that independence is unverified; do not promise agreement promotion before the receipt exists.
  - Announce the one fixed route and every recipient before dispatch. A route failure produces no artifact and may be retried only after the host resolves, sanctions, and discloses the new route. Reconcile `cross_model_target`, `cross_model_harness`, `cross_model_route`, `model_requested`, and `model_actual` from the artifact; never infer a serving model from the requested ID.
- **Interactive host, no peer resolved** (host un-attestable, or no different provider installed/authed): one quiet line that the cross-model pass was skipped and why. Never an error.
- **Non-interactive mode:** emit no user-facing prose. The script still emits a one-line stderr audit log per send that document content was sent cross-model to the named provider, so the third-party data egress is auditable even though the pass is silent to the user. Non-interactive still requires a reachable peer under the normal gates; an explicit `cross_model_peer:` in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` or a non-empty `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` allowlist is the preferred enablement surface when teams want fail-closed-by-default CI egress (unset allowlist still means the default availability order).

## Step 4 — Run the bundled script (one call per activated trio lens, in parallel with the persona reviewers)

Each call is a CLI shell-out, not a subagent. Resolve one target and one fixed route once per document review, then launch every activated lens against that same sanctioned target/route. Launch each call as a detached job through `scripts/peer-job-runner.py` in the same dispatch wave as the in-process reviewers. A failed route does not fall through inside the worker.

**Two modes — slice the trio, sweep the whole doc (R20, KTD6):**

- **Trio peers, sliced.** On **unified artifacts**, pass each activated trio lens the *same reviewer-specific slice its in-process twin got* as `<document-path>` (write that slice to a temp file — e.g. product-lens/adversarial get the Product Contract), not the full document, so the peer is a true corroborating twin rather than an off-lens reviewer. On legacy docs the peer gets the same full document the twin does.
- **One whole-doc sweep.** In the **same wave**, also launch **one** call with reviewer-name **`whole-doc`**, the **full** document (never sliced), and the same resolved provider — a broad different-model read of the entire doc. It runs **once per document** (not per lens), writes `whole-doc-<provider>.json`, and folds in as an independent reviewer that corroborates by fingerprint against *any* in-process finding (it has no in-process twin). Same gate, isolation, and non-blocking rules as the trio calls. A model following this contract MUST issue this `whole-doc` invocation whenever the pass runs, or the broad coverage R20/U9 promises is silently skipped.

Invoke via the skill-dir anchor — set `SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory of **this** skill's `SKILL.md` (the Bash tool's CWD is the user's project, not the skill dir, on every host; shell state does not persist between Bash calls, so set it inline in every runner call):

**Interpreter.** The commands below run a bundled Python script. Resolve the
interpreter in the *same* shell call as the command -- each tool call is a fresh
shell, so a `$PY` set in an earlier call does not persist. Do not hardcode
`python3`: on native Windows it resolves to a Microsoft Store stub that exits
without running Python, and that stub still satisfies `command -v`, so probe
execution rather than presence.

```bash
PY="$(for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "no working Python 3 interpreter on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
```

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-doc-review SKILL.md you read>";
PY="$(for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "no working Python 3 interpreter on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
SCRATCH_ROOT="/tmp/compound-engineering-$(id -u)";
if [ -L "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ]; then echo "unsafe scratch root symlink: $SCRATCH_ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi;
(umask 077; mkdir -p "$SCRATCH_ROOT") || exit 1;
if [ -L "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ] || [ ! -O "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ]; then echo "scratch root is not owned by the current user: $SCRATCH_ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi;
chmod 700 "$SCRATCH_ROOT" || exit 1;
RUN_DIR="$SCRATCH_ROOT/ce-doc-review/<run-id>"; (umask 077; mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR") || exit 1; chmod 700 "$RUN_DIR" || exit 1;
echo "peer-deadline-secs=$(( ${CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS:-1200} + 10 ))";
CE_PEER_HARD_SECS= CROSS_MODEL_HOST_HARNESS="<host-harness>" CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE="<fixed-route>" "$PY" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peer-job-runner.py" start --skill ce-doc-review --run-id "<run-id>" --label "<reviewer-name>" -- env CROSS_MODEL_HOST_HARNESS="<host-harness>" CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE="<fixed-route>" bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh" "<host-serving-family>" "<target>" "<reviewer-name>" "<document-path>" "<document-type>" "<origin>" "$RUN_DIR"
```

The nested windows are one budget with one knob, `CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS`. The runner derives its supervisor hard window from that ambient knob automatically (`max(1230, knob + 30)`). Clear `CE_PEER_HARD_SECS` on the start prefix (`CE_PEER_HARD_SECS=`) so a stale ambient value from an earlier session or harness export cannot undercut that derivation — an explicit numeric `CE_PEER_HARD_SECS` still wins when a skill deliberately sets one (ce-work / elevation), which this path must not do. Print the orchestrator deadline as `knob + 10` in the same shell as `start` (as above) and use that printed `peer-deadline-secs=<n>` below (all legs share the one value; re-use the first leg's number rather than re-deriving per leg); never hardcode it, because a literal survives a knob change and then reaps a healthy peer.

**Do not forward `CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS` to the worker.** The runner already passes the ambient environment through, so a knob the user actually set reaches the worker on its own. Re-exporting the orchestrator's *resolved* value would turn a fallback into an explicit override and destroy the one distinction the worker still needs: idle-guarded routes (codex + streaming claude/cursor-family) use the raised `HARD_SECS` default, while `grok-cli` keeps the lower `UNGUARDED_HARD_SECS` bound because its `--json-schema` path cannot stream. Forcing one value would silently restore the doubled hang on that hard-only route.

Omit `--result-path`; `done` means only that the worker exited. The fixed target determines the expected `<reviewer-name>-<target>.json` filename.

- `<host-serving-family>` is `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, `composer`, or `unknown`; `<host-harness>` is `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, `cursor`, or `unknown`.
- `<target>` is exactly one of `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, `cursor`, or `composer`; `<fixed-route>` is its already-sanctioned concrete route token from the Step 1 table (`codex`, `claude`, `grok-cli`, `grok-cursor`, `cursor`, or `composer`).
- `<reviewer-name>` = the activated lens (`security-lens`, `adversarial`, or `product-lens`). The script derives the persona-brief filename and (per provider) model from this allowlisted value — the brief path is never caller-controlled.
- `<document-path>` = the document under review.
- `<document-type>` = the Phase 1 classification (`requirements` / `plan` / `unified-requirements` / `unified-plan`).
- `<origin>` = the same `{origin_path}` slot the in-process personas receive.
- `<run-dir>` = the absolute `$RUN_DIR` resolved above. The script writes `<reviewer-name>-<provider>.json` there per resolved peer **only after** forcing `reviewer` to `<reviewer-name>-<provider>` and downgrading peer `safe_auto` → `gated_auto`.

Every runner call is bounded — no tool call ever spans a worker's runtime, on any host. Between dispatch waves, poll outstanding jobs (it returns early when the watched jobs settle):

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-doc-review SKILL.md you read>";
PY="$(for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "no working Python 3 interpreter on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
"$PY" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peer-job-runner.py" wait --max-secs 30 --json <job-ids...>
```

Capture the epoch time right after the final `start` (`date +%s`) — that anchor is how you know when the deadline passes, since nothing else tracks wall clock across tool calls. At synthesis, loop bounded `wait` calls until every job is terminal **or the shared peer deadline (`peer-deadline-secs`) has elapsed since the final `start`** (compare `date +%s` against the anchor before each slice) (do not begin a `wait` slice that would extend past the deadline — reap instead); at that deadline, `reap` each job still nonterminal, then run one final bounded `wait --max-secs 10` pass (reap is asynchronous — the terminal record lands a grace period after it returns), then fold in whichever `<reviewer-name>-<provider>.json` files exist in `<run-dir>`. The detached script still self-bounds (codex idle-timeout default 480s with reasoning forced on for liveness; hard backstop `CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS` default 1200s) and exits cleanly; the runner's supervisor windows sit outside those caps as the backstop. The script needs no prompt or schema passed in — it reads the persona brief, `findings-schema.json`, and the document itself from disk.

Any started job whose terminal state is not `done` (`failed` / `timeout` / `died-without-result` — a job reaped at the deadline records `timeout`, with the reap noted in its reason; a preflight failure never yields a job id — a genuine gate-not-met skip is the silent `never-started` case, but a dispatch-infrastructure crash before any job starts is not a clean skip and triggers the hand-recovery rule in Step 5) is named in the Coverage line with its lens and terminal state (e.g. "cross-model security-lens peer: timeout"); silent absence remains correct only for passes that were never started (gate not met / skip). A missing fold-in file is still "the pass didn't run for that lens," never a review failure — except when a dispatch-infrastructure crash voided the whole pass at once, which Step 5 handles as named whole-pass loss (the whole-doc broad read especially), not per-lens "not run." After fold-in, delete the consumed job dirs under `<run-dir>/jobs` (use the environment's preferred deletion command).

The cross-model pass does **not** receive the accumulated decision primer that in-process personas get on round 2+ — the peer prompt carries a round-1 framing regardless of round. This is deliberate (cross-model is most valuable on the first pass), and synthesis's own R29/R30 suppression is the authoritative backstop for re-raised or already-resolved findings, so a peer that re-raises a prior-round-rejected finding is dropped at synthesis, not surfaced.

## Step 5 — Fold into synthesis

- Read each fold-in artifact through the runner's verified read (resolve `$PY` in the same tool call — shells do not persist):

  ```bash
  SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-doc-review SKILL.md you read>";
  PY="$(for c in python3 python py; do command -v "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 && "$c" -c '' >/dev/null 2>&1 && { echo "$c"; break; }; done)"; [ -n "$PY" ] || { echo "no working Python 3 interpreter on PATH" >&2; exit 1; };
  "$PY" "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peer-job-runner.py" result --path <run-dir>/<reviewer-name>-<target>.json
  ```

  (fd-ownership-checked, bounded; exit 4 means unreadable -> treat as no file). If present, treat it as one reviewer return with `reviewer: <reviewer-name>-<target>`. It enters ordinary dedup, but enters cross-model agreement promotion **only when `independence_verified` is `true`**. A false or absent value may contribute findings but never raises an anchor. Peer returns never grant silent-apply authority.
- **No file, clean skip** (script skipped before starting real work: host un-attestable, no different provider reachable, CLI missing/unauthed, unparseable output, or lens not activated) → the pass simply didn't run for that lens. Note "cross-model pass: not run" in Coverage on an interactive host in default mode; stay silent in non-interactive mode. Never fail the review. Ignore any `*.raw.json` leftovers — they are not fold-in artifacts.
- **Dispatch-infrastructure failure vs. clean skip.** The clean skip above is a script that *chose* not to start real work. A dispatch-infrastructure crash is different — the runner or worker itself failed: a non-zero exit before any job starts, a preflight/detach failure, or an unresolved `$SKILL_DIR`/script path. Because every leg shares one runner, route, and `$SKILL_DIR`, such a crash typically drops the **whole** cross-model pass at once, not one lens. Do not fold it into the silent skip on the first error: re-run the **same resolved route** by hand — re-issuing the affected `start` calls with the target/model, the tool-less empty-scratch isolation posture, and the embedded-document read scope all held fixed — while each failure is a new, plausibly recoverable one and the shared peer deadline holds (a same-route retry, distinct from the quota rule below, which requires a newly disclosed route). Stop and drop the cross-model pass once a failure repeats or the deadline is spent. Each trio lens is still covered by its in-process twin; what an infra crash silently voids is the **whole-doc broad read** (the sweep leg has no twin) plus cross-model corroboration — name that loss in the Coverage line rather than letting it disappear as "not run." A hand recovery may not substitute a different target or provider, widen the read scope beyond the embedded document, or relax the read-only empty-scratch posture.
- **Started but not `done`** (the job's final state is `failed` / `timeout` / `died-without-result`) → still non-blocking, but never silent: name the lens and terminal state in Coverage per Step 4's naming rule.
- **Classify the skip reason before the job dirs are deleted.** When a peer produced no usable output or ended non-`done`, read its `out.log` before cleanup, including bounded lines prefixed `peer skip evidence:`. Name observed quota, authentication, or capability failure specifically. An authentication-shaped peer failure (`not logged in`, `please log in`, 401, or CLI text prompting login) describes only the peer's execution context: a sandboxed host — e.g. a restricted Codex task denying spawned commands network or keychain access — produces the identical signal to a genuine account logout, so classify it as a cross-model execution-context authentication failure and never report it as the user's account being logged out or prompt the user to run a login command on that basis. The cross-model pass is additive and the in-process reviewers still covered their lenses; obtaining it requires a context where the peer CLI can reach the network (for example, outside the restricted sandbox). After the same quota or usage-limit evidence appears more than once in this session, do not retry that route automatically. A retry uses a newly resolved and disclosed fixed route; never silently continue to another recipient.
- Empty `findings` → note "cross-model pass: no additional issues" in Coverage.
- A finding sharing a dedup fingerprint with its in-process twin (`<reviewer-name>`) promotes by one anchor step only when the artifact records `independence_verified: true`. Cursor-default artifacts default false; an unattested host skips automatic dispatch. Twin match uses section+title or same section with >50% evidence-substring overlap.

## Trust boundary (maintainers)

The script embeds the **full document content** into the peer prompt and sends it to an external model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, or Cursor, depending on the resolved peer). This is a wider egress than a diff-only review. `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` restricts which providers may receive content. The peer runs strictly read-only, from an empty scratch run-dir, with no project context — every route denies writes, network, MCP, and subagents. On **reads** the routes split into two tiers: **truly tool-less** — claude (`--safe-mode --tools ""`, all built-in tools disabled and custom behavior suppressed, run from the scratch dir) and grok (`--deny Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash`/`Task`/web/`mcp__*` with `--cwd <scratch>`), which have no read tool at all; and **read-only residual** — codex (`-s read-only -C <scratch>`) and cursor-agent (`--mode ask --sandbox enabled --workspace <scratch>`), which still permit *read* tools (see the accepted residual below). Impact is bounded to disclosure, not repo mutation — and because the reviewed document is the maintainer's own and the host agent already has more repo access than any peer, the read residual adds no material exposure.

**Accepted read residual (codex + cursor-agent routes):** codex (`-s read-only`) and cursor-agent (`--mode ask`) are read-only but retain a *read* tool — codex can also run read-only shell commands and read outside the scratch dir; cursor-agent can Read. Neither can be made truly tool-less (read-only is codex's sandbox floor; ask-mode is cursor-agent's), so they are a weaker isolation posture than the tool-less claude/grok routes. This is an **accepted** risk for ce-doc-review's own-document threat model — the reviewed documents are the maintainer's own planning docs (low injection surface), and the host agent already runs in-repo with strictly more privilege than any peer, so a peer that can read a file the host could already read (and send it to a provider the document already egresses to) adds no materially new exposure. The routes are kept, not fail-closed; the script's stderr audit log records each send so the egress is auditable even in non-interactive mode.
