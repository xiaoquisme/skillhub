# Diff Scope Rules

These rules apply to every reviewer. They define what is "your code to review" versus pre-existing context.

## Scope Discovery

Determine the diff to review using this priority order:

1. **User-specified scope.** If the caller passed `BASE:`, `FILES:`, or `DIFF:` markers, use that scope exactly.
2. **Working copy changes.** If there are unstaged or staged changes (`git diff HEAD` is non-empty), review those.
3. **Unpushed commits vs base branch.** If the working copy is clean, review `git diff $(git merge-base HEAD <base>)..HEAD` where `<base>` is the default branch (main or master).

The scope step in the SKILL.md handles discovery and passes you the resolved diff. You do not need to run git commands yourself unless PR scope mode requires it (below).

## Remote scope (`pr-remote` and `branch-remote`)

When the review context includes `<pr-scope-mode>pr-remote</pr-scope-mode>` or `<pr-scope-mode>branch-remote</pr-scope-mode>`, the working tree is **not** the reviewed head. Do **not** use Read/Grep on workspace paths for files in the changed-file list — they may not match the branch or PR under review.

Instead:

- Prefer `git show <remote-head-ref>:<path>` when `<pr-head-ref>` or `<branch-head-ref>` is provided in context.
- Otherwise rely on diff hunks in the provided `<diff>` only.
- Do not treat local workspace contents as evidence for findings on changed files.

## Evidence Tools (tool-adaptive)

Recall depends on how you find related code. A diff-local read plus a text `grep` misses callers reached through re-exports, aliases, and barrel files, and mis-hits identifiers inside strings, comments, or longer names. When a claim depends on a symbol's callers, implementations, or whether a construct appears elsewhere, use the strongest search your harness actually exposes, preferring in this order and falling through when a tier is unavailable:

1. **Symbol-aware search** — a references/definitions/implementations capability (LSP or an equivalent MCP tool) that follows renames, re-exports, and barrels text search cannot. Most reviewer harnesses do not expose one; when it is absent, drop to the next tier without ceremony.
2. **Structural (AST) search** — a syntax-tree matcher such as `ast-grep` (optional; may not be installed). For "does construct X occur elsewhere" it beats regex: it matches the parsed tree, ignoring formatting and skipping the string/comment hits `grep` reports as false positives.
3. **Text search (`grep`)** — always available; correct for genuinely lexical checks (config keys, string literals, log messages), and the fallback when the tiers above are not reachable.

No tool is complete: dynamic dispatch, reflection, dependency injection, string-keyed routes/config, generated code, and external consumers hide usages from all of them. This only bites a claim that rests on *exhaustive* coverage — "this symbol is unused," "nothing else calls this," "safe to change." For such a claim, when coverage is text-search-only or a hiding construct could apply, record the unresolved boundary in `residual_risks` (e.g. `callsite completeness: grep-only`) or step the finding down, rather than asserting absence or safety. A finding that does not turn on exhaustive coverage needs no such note.

In `pr-remote` / `branch-remote` scope these tiers inspect the working tree, which is not the reviewed head — apply the Remote scope rules above (`git show` / `git grep <remote-head-ref>`) instead of local search.

## Finding Classification Tiers

Every finding you report falls into one of three tiers based on its relationship to the diff:

### Primary (directly changed code)

Lines added or modified in the diff. This is your main focus. Report findings against these lines at full confidence.

### Secondary (immediately surrounding code)

Unchanged code within the same function, method, or block as a changed line. If a change introduces a bug that's only visible by reading the surrounding context, report it -- but note that the issue exists in the interaction between new and existing code.

### Pre-existing (unrelated to this diff)

Issues in unchanged code that the diff didn't touch and doesn't interact with. Mark these as `"pre_existing": true` in your output. They're reported separately and don't count toward the review verdict. When history is what makes the pre-existing call, attach one concise provenance evidence line from targeted blame/log (see the load-bearing line provenance rule in `subagent-template.md`).

**The rule:** If you'd flag the same issue on an identical diff that didn't include the surrounding file, it's pre-existing. If the diff makes the issue *newly relevant* (e.g., a new caller hits an existing buggy function), it's secondary.
