"""Detached peer-job runner: start/status/wait/result/reap for delegated work.

Some harnesses enforce a hard ceiling on a single shell tool call and kill the
supervising shell mid-run, so no tool call may span a peer worker's runtime.
This runner splits the lifecycle so every call is short and all durable state
lives on disk:

  start   claim a job dir, preflight the worker, detach it into its own
          session (double fork with os.setsid between the forks), print ONLY
          the job id, return fast. The detached process supervises the worker
          and writes ONE atomic terminal record. Also sweeps sibling run roots
          older than 24 hours (best-effort, owner-checked).
  status  print each job's state word without blocking.
  wait    bounded poll (~1s cadence, never longer than --max-secs) that
          returns early once every watched job has settled.
  result  ownership-checked bounded read of a done job's published artifact.
  reap    ask the detached supervisor to terminate the job now; returns fast.
          If the supervisor itself is gone, reap kills the worker tree and
          writes the terminal record itself. Reaping a terminal job is a
          safe no-op.

Job directory (durable state, the source of truth):
  <root>/<skill>/<run-id>/jobs/<job-id>/
    meta.json   identity: skill, run id, label, input digest, start time,
                worker argv, result path (written at start, before detach)
    pid         supervisor pid + worker pid (written by the supervisor before
                start returns; its presence marks "detached"). Two fields are
                platform-conditional, so consumers must use .get(): POSIX adds
                supervisor_pgid, Windows adds job_name (its job object).
    out.log     worker's combined stdout+stderr (byte growth = liveness)
    reason      terminal detail, written before the status rename so the
                status file is always the LAST record to land
    status      exactly one word, published atomically (tmp + os.replace):
                done | failed | timeout | died-without-result

States reported by status/wait:
  running              detached, no terminal record yet
  done                 worker exited 0 (and, when --result-path was declared,
                       the result file exists non-empty)
  failed               nonzero exit, byte-cap kill, or exit 0 without the
                       declared result
  timeout              supervisor idle/hard window fired, or a requested reap
  died-without-result  worker killed by an external signal with no result
                       evidence (or vanished together with its supervisor)
  never-started        meta exists but nothing was ever detached (preflight
                       failure)
  unreadable           an ownership or sanity check failed; content withheld

Supervision (runs inside the detached session, never in a tool call): poll
~2s; liveness is out.log byte growth; idle window with no growth reaps the
worker tree; a hard cap reaps it regardless; byte caps on out.log and the
published result classify as failed with a recorded reason. Reaping is TERM
to the worker's own process group (the worker is started as a session/group
leader), a grace period, then KILL — with a deepest-first tree walk as the
fallback when the group kill is unavailable. The supervisor classifies the
outcome exactly once; when both the worker's internal cap and the
supervisor's window fire, the supervisor's record wins.

Environment overrides (defaults in parentheses):
  CE_PEER_JOBS_ROOT         base dir (/tmp/compound-engineering-<effective-uid>)
  CE_WORK_RUNS_ROOT         parent CE Work dir containing all <run-id>/ dirs
  CE_PEER_IDLE_SECS         idle window, no out.log growth (240)
  CE_PEER_HARD_SECS         hard cap on worker wall clock
                            (default: max(1230, CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS+30);
                            an explicit value always wins)
  CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS     when CE_PEER_HARD_SECS is unset, widens the
                            supervisor hard window (see above)
  CE_PEER_LOG_MAX_BYTES     out.log byte cap (10485760)
  CE_PEER_RESULT_MAX_BYTES  result byte cap, supervise + read (5242880)
  CE_PEER_POLL_SECS         supervisor poll interval (2)
  CE_PEER_GRACE_SECS        TERM-to-KILL grace during reap (5)
  CE_PEER_BASH              Windows: absolute bash.exe for peer workers
                            (preferred over PATH / WSL System32 bash)
  CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH Claude Code Git Bash path; used on Windows when
                            CE_PEER_BASH is unset (#1268)

Security posture: the job root is a predictable, owner-private directory under
world-shared /tmp. Every read of job state opens the file first (no-follow) and
verifies the descriptor's owner (os.fstat st_uid == os.geteuid, guarded where
geteuid is unavailable) before any content is emitted; a mismatch reports
"unreadable", never content. Reads are bounded by size caps — out.log is never
slurped. Directory/file creation uses 0700/0600 modes, exclusive no-follow
creation, owner/type verification on path components, exact 0700 verification
on the top-level root, and atomic rename for every publish. The worker argv is
exec'd directly (argv list, never a shell); job
ids are minted internally; --skill/--run-id/--label are restricted to
[A-Za-z0-9._-]. Nothing here ever prompts: headless/CI-safe by design.

Platform (#1243): the mechanisms above describe POSIX. Native Windows Python
has no fork/setsid, uid, mode bits, or process groups, so the same contract is
met by win32 equivalents, all behind `sys.platform == "win32"` branches so the
POSIX path is behaviorally unchanged:
  detach    re-invoke this script as a DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP
            child (CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB where the job allows) running the
            internal `__supervise` entrypoint; the pid file is the ack.
  reap      cmd_reap drops a `.reap` marker the supervisor polls for (no directed
            signal to a detached, console-less process).
  teardown  the worker tree lives in a named Job Object -- the real killpg
            analog, since it reaches descendants of an already-exited leader,
            which taskkill /T cannot (it walks parent->child from a LIVE
            parent). Windows releases a named object's name once the last
            handle closes, so a cmd_reap running after the supervisor died
            falls back to a Toolhelp32 snapshot walk; that works because
            Windows never reparents orphans, so a dead pid still appears as
            th32ParentProcessID on its live children.
  ownership st_uid == geteuid becomes: the object's owner SID is one this token
            creates objects as (user or default-owner SID), checked on the opened
            handle (GetSecurityInfo) exactly like the POSIX fstat-by-fd check.
  privacy   0700/0600 modes become a hardened ACL (icacls: break inheritance,
            grant only the user + SYSTEM + Administrators — the root-equivalents).
  jobs root defaults under %LOCALAPPDATA%\\compound-engineering-jobs (then the
            user temp dir), owner-private, since there is no shared /tmp.

Pure stdlib. No third-party dependencies.
